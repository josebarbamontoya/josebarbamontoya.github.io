	<h1>Jose Barba-Montoya</h1>
	<p>I am an evolutionary biologist studying patterns of molecular evolution and diversification of plants and animals. My research combines phylogenetics/phylogenomics with systematics and ecology, and applies evolutionary frameworks to infer species divergence times and molecular evolutionary rates for establishing a timescale for the tree of life. This timescale is necessary to understand how species evolve â€” one of the most important questions in biology. Another part of my research is focused on evaluating and developing methods of molecular clock dating and phylogenomics. Analysis of large-scale genomic data for evaluation of evolutionary hypothesis is also a part of my research</em>. <a href="/about">Read more about me...</a></p>
