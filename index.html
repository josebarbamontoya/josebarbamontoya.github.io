	<p>I study patterns of molecular evolution and species diversification across the tree of life by integrating phylogenetics/phylogenomics with systematics and ecology. My primary focus lies in inferring evolutionary relationships and divergence times of species and subspecies. The inference of accurate timetrees is crucial for understanding major transitions in the evolution of genomes and species. Despite the abundance of data and powerful analysis methods, challenges persist in constructing reliable timetrees. Understanding the different sources of errors and uncertainties, as well as the strategies to address them, is fundamental for constructing an accurate tree of life. Given these considerations, another aspect of my research is dedicated to developing methods for phylogenomic analysis and molecular clock dating that mitigate the factors contributing to error and improve the accuracy of the reconstruction of the tree of life.</em> <a href="/about">Read more about me...</a></p>
