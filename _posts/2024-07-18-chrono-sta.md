By integrating the phylogenetic time dimension, Chrono-STA enables the construction of supertrees from taxonomically restricted molecular timetrees with minimal species overlap. The software (chronosta.py) and a tutorial for this method are available at <a href="https://github.com/josebarbamontoya/chrono-sta">https://github.com/josebarbamontoya/chrono-sta.</a>
