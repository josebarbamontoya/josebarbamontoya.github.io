title: "Bioinformatic resource: RelTime joint analysis (RelTime-JA) infers jointly phylogeny and divergence times"
date: 2023-04-11
---
RelTime-JA combines bootstrap resampling, maximum likelihood, and RelTime approaches for simultaneously inferring evolutionary relationships, divergence times, and confidence intervals incorporating phylogeny uncertainty. Software, R code, and shell scripts required to carry out the RelTime-JA analysis, and a tutorial of the method are available at <a href="https://github.com/josebarbamontoya/pu_dating"> https://github.com/josebarbamontoya/pu_dating.</a>
